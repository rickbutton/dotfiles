Rick Button's dotfiles
=====================

These are my dotfiles, custom tailored to my preferences and work style.
If you find anything you like, take it! 

I use Arch Linux and Mac OSX, and the `setup.sh` script just checks
whether or not you are on Linux or Darwin, so I doubt it will work very well
on other distros.
